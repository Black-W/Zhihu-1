Genetically Modified Crops
<p>
	We understand consumers have questions and strong preferences about the foods they eat, and we continue to actively monitor the science, regulations and our consumers’ preferences on numerous topics, including ingredients from genetically modified (GM) crops.
</p>
<p>
	Leading health organizations worldwide have concluded that GM ingredients are safe, based on the results of more than 400 studies. This approach adds desirable traits from one plant to another, without introducing anything unnatural or using chemicals, so crops grow quicker, are more plentiful and potentially more nutritious. GM ingredients have been around for the past 20 years, are represented in the vast majority of the foods on grocery shelves in many countries, and help keep food costs down. They also help feed the hungry and malnourished in developing nations.
</p>
<p>
	However, in some markets around the world we do not use GM ingredients, based on input from our consumers and local availability. Because we predominantly source ingredients in the markets where they are sold, Kellogg foods likely include ingredients derived from GM crops in the same proportion that they occur in the local supply chain.
</p>
<p>
	In the U.S., for example, genetically modified crops such as corn and soy have been grown for the past two decades, and GM corn accounts for 97 percent of the commonly available type of food corn grown in the U.S. and used by Kellogg. The U.S. wheat and rice used by Kellogg are non-GM, as those crops do not have commercially available GM seeds for selection by U.S. farmers.
</p>
<p>
	For U.S. consumers who prefer alternatives, existing nationwide labeling programs give people the information they need. These include “certified organic,” “GE-free,” and “Non-GMO Project Verified” labeling. Our Kashi brand, in fact, offers a variety of Non-GMO Project Verified options.
</p>
<p>
	We will continue to review information from the scientific and regulatory agencies on this topic, as well as our consumers’ preferences.

	Does Kellogg use GMO grains or products in their food production?

Since we purchase the majority of our U.S. crops from U.S. farmers--and genetically modified crops have been grown in the U.S. for the past two decades--our foods likely include ingredients derived from genetically modified crops in the same proportion that they occur in the United States food supply. Leading health organizations worldwide have concluded that GMOs are safe. Genetic modification has the ability to increase the nutrition value of our food while allowing farmers to use fewer pesticides. For U.S. consumers who prefer an alternative, our Kashi brand offers a variety of organic and Non-GMO Project Verified options. Thank you again for your feedback.
