这其实是个很有趣的想法，有人尝试用番茄表达小RNA用于治疗目的。后续结果不清楚。但类似的想法是有人尝试的

Eric Lam has independently been investigating the possibility of edible plant-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to be taken up in the mammalian GI tract after ingestion of transgenic tomatoes since 2001. His group has discovered essentially the same phenomenon as these workers using rabbits as the model system. Eric Lam has filed a patent disclosure for the use of this technology to deliver small RNAs (including both siRNAs and miRNAs) for therapeutic purposes in April 2011.
