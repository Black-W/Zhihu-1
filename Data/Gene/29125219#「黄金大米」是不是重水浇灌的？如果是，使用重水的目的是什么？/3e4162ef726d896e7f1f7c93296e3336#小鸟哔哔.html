	Intrinsically deuterium-labeled GR grains and spinach
were harvested from a hydroponic plant system (housed in the USDA-Agriculture
Research Service Children's Nutrition Research Center in Houston, TX) by
growing the plants with heavy water (deuterium oxide, D2O), introduced into the
growth medium shortly after the start of seed fill (in the case of rice), or at
the initiation of planting (spinach), as previously described (

	). GR grains were
harvested at maturity, air dried for 3 d, and then dehulled, milled, and stored
at −70°C until being shipped to Boston for cooking, as previously described (

	). Similarly,
spinach plants were harvested and packed as fresh leaves (with ice) and were
shipped the next day to Boston for cooking and processing as previously
described (

	通过无土培育系统，运用重水（氧化氘）培育出干预所用的带有内源性标记物（氘）的黄金大米（由美国农业部农业研究服务儿童营养研究中心研制，德克萨斯州，休斯敦市）。以大米为例，将种子填充完毕后立即引入上述培养系统，或者在栽植时就开始引入。黄金大米培育成熟后，经过3天晾晒、脱壳、碾磨后，存入零下70°冰箱，运往波士顿烹调。相同的，菠菜作为新鲜蔬菜第二天冷链运输至波士顿。
