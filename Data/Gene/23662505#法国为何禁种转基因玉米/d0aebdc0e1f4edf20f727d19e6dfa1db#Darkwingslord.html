摘头两段
<br>
<br>
The French parliament gave final approval on Monday to a law prohibiting the cultivation of any variety of genetically modified maize in the European Union's top grain producer, where
<b>
	 a majority of people remain strongly opposed to foods based on genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.
</b>
<br>
<br>
The French Senate voted on a law already adopted by the lower house of parliament last month that 
<b>
	banned GMO maize (corn) cultivation,
	<i>
		 even though it has been cleared at European Union level
	</i>
	, saying it poses a risk to the environment.

另外据说法国自己是不种，但是德国种的转基因作物都做成饲料卖到法国去。。没找到确实的出处，错了就当我没说。
