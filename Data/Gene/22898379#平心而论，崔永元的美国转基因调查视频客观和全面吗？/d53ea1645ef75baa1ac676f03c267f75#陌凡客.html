我看到很多说小崔考察转基因哪里出了问题的，其中有个说法是Nancy Swanson没有和生物学和转基因发生过任何关系，这才是大大的谬误,谷歌下就知道，她已经研究了CMOs（Genetical Modified Organisms）好多年，Swanson herself became seriously ill with a number of complaints 10 years ago and found that after stopping eating GMOs her symptoms got dramatically better. This led her to start her journey of discovery: “About every other week the Seattle Times published something about how this or that is skyrocketing (Parkinson’s, dementia, Alzheimer’s, ADHD, suicide). I was pondering this and I had an inspiration to look at the data and compare it to the amount of GMOs on the market. The more I found the scarier it got.”，其它就不说啦，你看到的诋毁很多，比如他们会说Dr. Swanson, who has a  Ph.D. in physics and worked as a staff scientist for the United States Navy, holds five U.S. patents and is the author of over 30 scientific publications and two books on women in science.没有和生物与转基因的研究，纯属胡扯臆断，所以相信小崔，因为他这样做没有任何好处，完全为了大家的健康
