Good morning, Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Pallone, and Members of the Subcommittee.  I am Michael M. Landa, Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss FDA’s regulatory program for genetically engineered (GE) food.[1]
<br>
Over the last 20 years, FDA has reviewed and evaluated data and information on more than 150 GE plant-derived foods, ranging from herbicide-tolerant soybeans to canola oil with a modified fatty acid profile.  In a 1992 policy statement on foods derived from new plant varieties (including GE plant varieties), FDA stated that the Agency was not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these methods (i.e., genetic engineering) differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding.  This 1992 statement and its scientific underpinnings still reflect FDA’s current thinking about foods derived from GE plants and, based on our evaluations, we are confident that the GE foods in the U.S. marketplace today are as safe as their conventional counterparts.
