		World Scientists Statement
	</a>
</p>
<p>
	我简单的翻译一下他们反对转基因的理由：
</p>
<p>
	1： Patents on life-forms and living processes should be banned because they threaten food security, sanction biopiracy of indigenous knowledge and genetic resources, violate basic human rights and dignity, compromise healthcare, impede medical and scientific research and are against the welfare of animals. 
</p>
<p>
	生命被专利化侵害人权
</p>
<p>
	2 GM crops offer no benefits to farmers or consumers. Instead, many problems have been identified, including yield drag, increased herbicide use, erratic performance, and poor economic returns to farmers. GM crops also intensify corporate monopoly on food, which is driving family farmers to destitution, and preventing the essential shift to sustainable agriculture that can guarantee food security and health around the world 
</p>
<p>
	转基因没有给农民和消费者带来任何好处，减少收成，增加农药使用，导致农民收入减少，强化了食物的垄断，导致可持续农业的发展困难等等
</p>
<p>
	3 Two simple characteristics account for the nearly 40 million hectares of GM crops planted in 1999(2). The majority (71%) are tolerant to broad-spectrum herbicides, with companies engineering plants to be tolerant to their own brand of herbicide, while most of the rest are engineered with bt-toxins to kill insect pests. A university-based survey of 8200 field trials of the most widely grown GM crops, herbicide-tolerant soya beans - revealed that they yield 6.7% less and required two to five times more herbicides than non-GM varieties(3). This has been confirmed by a more recent study in the University of Nebraska(4). Yet other problems have been identified: erratic performance, disease susceptibility(5), fruit abortion(6) and poor economic returns to farmers(7). 
</p>
<p>
	转基因面积的迅速扩大的原因在于转基因和除草剂和BT农药的捆绑，转基因可以促成这些产品的销售，根据一个对8200份田野调查而得到的结果，最广泛种植的转基因，导致了6,7%的的收成减少，和2到5倍的农药的使用（参考文献3），这一点被最近的University of Nebraska的研究(参考文献4)所证实，还有很多问题也被确定：漂移不定的性状，抗病性下降（50，营养损失(6)，农民经济收入的减少(7)
</p>
<p>
	 4. According to the UN food programme, there is enough food to feed the world one and a half times over. While world population has grown 90% in the past 40 years, the amount of food per capita has increased by 25%, yet one billion are hungry(8). A new FAO report confirms that there will be enough or more than enough food to meet global demands without taking into account any yield improvementsthat might result from GM crops well into 2030 (9). It is on account of increasing corporate monopoly operating under the globalised economy that the poor are getting poorer and hungrier(10). Family farmers around the world have been driven to destitution and suicide, and for the same reasons. Between 1993 and 1997 the number of mid-sized farms in the US dropped by 74,440(11), and farmers are now receiving below the average cost of production for their produce(12). The farming population in France and Germany fell by 50% since 1978(13). In the UK, 20 000 farming jobs were lost in the past year alone, and the Prime Minister has announced a £200m aid package(14). Four corporations control 85% of the world trade in cereals at the end of 1999(15). Mergers and acquisitions are continuing. 
</p>
<p>
	根据联合国的事物计划，食物足够喂饱全球人口的一倍半，根据国际粮农组织估算，至少直到2030年，排除任何的转基因可能带来收益的影响，食物也是够的。由于全球化背景下的越来越严重的农业垄断，全球农民越来越多的走向破产和自杀，在昧国，1993年到1997年，中等规模农户下降了74440户，农户收入下降到了平均线以下。
</p>
<p>
	四个大企业也控制了全球贸易的85%。
</p>
<p>
	5 The new patents on seeds intensify corporate monopoly by preventing farmers from saving and replanting seeds, which is what most farmers still do in the Third World. In order to protect their patents, corporations are continuing to develop terminator technologies that genetic engineer harvested seeds not to germinate, despite worldwide opposition from farmers and civil society at large(16). 
</p>
<p>
	基因的专利法增强了跨国公司的垄断，为了保护他们的专利，跨国公司正在通过各种技术导致他们的种子不能用来育种，这导致了发展中国家的农户的困境。
</p>
<p>
	6 Christian Aid, a major charity working with the Third World, concluded that GM crops will cause unemployment, exacerbate Third World debt, threaten sustainable farming systems and damage the environment. It predicts famine for the poorest countries(17). African Governments condemned Monsanto's claim that GMOs are needed to feed the hungry of the world: "We..strongly object that the image of the poor and hungry from our countries is being used by giant multinational corporations to push a technology that is neither safe, environmentally friendly, nor economically beneficial to us… we believe it will destroy the diversity, the local knowledge and the sustainable agricultural systems that our farmers have developed for millennia and …undermine our capacity to feed ourselves.(18)" A message from the Peasant movement of the Philippines to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of the industrialized countries stated, "The entry of GMOs will certainly intensify landlessness, hunger and injustice.(19)

</p>
<p>
	7. A coalition of family farming groups in the US have issued a comprehensive list of demands, including ban on ownership of all life-forms; suspension of sales, environmental releases and further approvals of all GM crops and products pending an independent, comprehensive assessment of the social, environmental, health and economic impacts; and for corporations to be made liable for all damages arising from GM crops and products to livestock, human beings and the environment(20). They also demand a moratorium on all corporate mergers and acquisitions, on farm closures, and an end to policies that serve big agribusiness interests at the expense of family farmers, taxpayers and the environment(21). They have mounted a lawsuit against Monsanto and nine other corporations for monopolistic practices and for foisting GM crops on farmers without adequate safety and environmental impact assessments(22). 
</p>
<p>
	昧国农业组织列出了一个清单，要求禁止对生命的占有，暂停销售，对转基因进行独立的详实的更进一步的对转基因对社会，环境，健康，经济影响，并且要求跨国公司对各种损失承担的义务的评估，他们要求农业政策必须停止只为大企业服务而不为农民服务，他们还对孟山都等公司发起了诉讼
</p>
<p>
	8  Some of the hazards of GM crops are openly acknowledged by the UK and US Governments. UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has admitted that the transfer of GM crops and pollen beyond the planted fields is unavoidable(23), and this has already resulted in herbicide-tolerant weeds(24). An interim report on UK Government-sponsored field trials confirmed hybridisation between adjacent plots of different herbicide tolerant GM oilseed rape varieties, which gave rise to hybrids tolerant to multiple herbicides. In addition, GM oilseed rape and their hybrids were found as volunteers in subsequent wheat and barley crops, which had to be controlled by standard herbicides(25). Bt-resistant insect pests have evolved in response to the continuous presence of the toxins in GM plants throughout the growing season, and the US Environment Protection Agency is recommending farmers to plant up to 40% non-GM crops in order to create refugia for non-resistant insect pests(26). 
</p>
<p>
	转基因的一些危害已经是昧国和英国政府的公开秘密,英国农业部承认转基因通过花粉传播是不可避免的，昧国环保部门要求农户至少种植40%以上的非转基因为没有抵抗力的昆虫避难。
</p>
<p>
	9  The threats to biodiversity from major GM crops already commercialized are becoming increasingly clear. The broad-spectrum herbicides used with herbicide-tolerant GM crops decimate wild plant species indiscriminately, they are also toxic to animals. Glufosinate causes birth defects in mammals(27), and glyphosate is linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma(28). GM crops with bt-toxins kill beneficial insects such as bees(29) and lacewings(30), and pollen from bt-corn is found to be lethal to monarch butterflies(31) as well as swallowtails(32). Bt-toxin is exuded from roots of bt-plants in the rhizosphere, where it rapidly binds to soil particles and become protected from degradation. As the toxin is present in an activated, non-selective form, both target and non-target species in the soil will be affected(33), with knock on effects on species above ground

</p>
<p>
	10，  Products resulting from genetically modified organisms can also be hazardous. For example, a batch of tryptophan produced by GM microorganisms was associated with at least 37 deaths and 1500 serious illnesses(34). Genetically modified Bovine Growth Hormone, injected into cows in order to increase milk yield, not only causes excessive suffering and illnesses for the cows but increases IGF-1 in the milk, which is linked to breast and prostate cancers in humans(35). It is vital for the public to be protected from all GM products, and not only those containing transgenic DNA or protein. That is because the process of genetic modification itself, at least in the form currently practised, is inherently unsafe 
</p>
<p>
	转基因产品有毒，例如，一种用转基因微生物生产的色氨酸和至少37人的死亡和1500人的严重伤残有关，转基因生产的牛奶激素，注射到奶牛中，不仅没有导致奶牛产量增加，反而导致了奶牛的严重的疾病导致了IGF-1的增加，这种物质和 乳腺癌和前列腺癌 有关。由于基因的自我修复机制，不仅是和被转的DNA和蛋白质，只要是近期在活动的所有物质都不是安全的。
</p>
<p>
	11 Secret memoranda of US Food and Drug Administration revealed that it ignored the warnings of its own scientists that genetic engineering is a new departure and introduces new risks. Furthermore, the first GM crop to be commercialized - the Flavr Savr tomato - did not pass the required toxicological tests(36). Since then, no comprehensive scientific safety testing had been done until Dr. Arpad Pusztai and his collaborators in the UK raised serious concerns over the safety of the GM potatoes they were testing. They conclude that a significant part of the toxic effect may be due to the "[gene] construct or the genetic transformation (or both)" used in making the GM plants(37).

</p>
<p>
	12  The safety of GM foods was openly disputed by Professor Bevan Moseley, molecular geneticist and current Chair of the Working Group on Novel Foods in the European Union's Scientific Committee on Food(38). He drew attention to unforseen effects inherent to the technology, emphasizing that the next generation of GM foods - the so-called 'neutraceuticals' or 'functional foods', such as vitamin A 'enriched' rice - will pose even greater health risks because of the increased complexity of the gene constructs.

</p>
<p>
	13 Genetic engineering introduces new genes and new combinations of genetic material constructed in the laboratory into crops, livestock and microorganisms(39). The artificial constructs are derived from the genetic material of pathogenic viruses and other genetic parasites, as well as bacteria and other organisms, and include genes coding for antibiotic resistance. The constructs are designed to break down species barriers and to overcome mechanisms that prevent foreign genetic material from inserting into genomes. Most of them have never existed in nature in the course of billions of years of evolution. 
</p>
<p>
	转基因通过来源于各种微生物的基因，来打破基因的自我保护而创造新的基因和基因结构，这些都是几十亿年来的生物进化所没有的
</p>
<p>
	14 These constructs are introduced into cells by invasive methods that lead to random insertion of the foreign genes into the genomes (the totality of all the genetic material of a cell or organism). This gives rise to unpredictable, random effects, including gross abnormalities in animals and unexpected toxins and allergens in food crops. 
</p>
<p>
	这些基因结构通过侵略随机插入外源基因的方式，导致了不可预测的随机的影响，诸如动物的变异，和不可预期的毒素和过敏物质。
</p>
<p>
	15 One construct common to practically all GM crops already commercialized or undergoing field trials involves a gene-switch (promoter) from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) spliced next to the foreign gene (transgene) to make it over-express continuously(40). This CaMV promoter is active in all plants, in yeast, algae and E. coli. We recently discovered that it is even active in amphibian egg(41) and human cell extract(42). It has a modular structure, and is interchangeable, in part, or in whole with promoters of other viruses to give infectious viruses. It also has a 'recombination hotspot' where it is prone to break and join up with other genetic material(43). 
</p>
<p>
	一个被普遍使用的是来自(CaMV病毒的启动子，和外源基因连接以后让其在生物中发生持续性的过度表达，这种启动子在所有的植物中都是活性的，我们最近发现，它甚至在两栖动物的卵，在人类提取的细胞中也有活性，这是一个模块化的可变的结构，部分或全部的导致了导致其他病毒具有感染力，它也有一个“重组热点”它倾向于破碎并且加入到其他的基因材料中。
</p>
<p>
	16， . For these and other reasons, transgenic DNA - the totality of artificial constructs transferred into the GMO - may be more unstable and prone to transfer again to unrelated species; potentially to all species interacting with the GMO(44). 
</p>
<p>
	以上原因，导致了转阴是不稳定，并且倾向于转变成其他的非相关的物种，导致所有的物种都有着潜在的被转基因侵染的风险
</p>
<p>
	17  The instability of transgenic DNA in GM plants is well-known(45). GM genes are often silenced, but loss of part or all of the transgenic DNA also occurs, even during later generations of propagation(46). We are aware of no published evidence for the long term stability of GM inserts in terms of structure or location in the plant genome in any of the GM lines already commercialized or undergoing field trials. 
</p>
<p>
	转基因的不稳定性已经被很多人知晓，转基因常常沉默，丢失部分的被转DNA也是常常发生的，即使是最新一代的产品也是这样，我们没有看到有关于转基因的长期稳定性的报告，尽管转基因已经被商业化。
</p>
<p>
	18 The potential hazards of horizontal transfer of GM genes include the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to pathogens, the generation of new viruses and bacteria that cause disease and mutations due to the random insertion of foreign DNA, some of which may lead to cancer in mammalian cells(47). The ability of the CaMV promoter to function in all species including human beings is particularly relevant to the potential hazards of horizontal gene transfer. 
</p>
<p>
	潜在危险还包括对病原体具有抗性的基因的水平转移，产生新的病毒和病菌可能导致疾病，其中一些可能导致哺乳动物细胞的癌变，CaMV启动子特别的可能引发各种水平转移的危害。
</p>
<p>
	 19 The possibility for naked or free DNA to be taken up by mammalian cells is explicitly mentioned in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance to industry on antibiotic resistance marker genes(48). In commenting on the FDA's document, the UK MAFF pointed out that transgenic DNA may be transferred not just by ingestion, but by contact with plant dust and air-borne pollen during farm work and food processing(49). This warning is all the more significant with the recent report from Jena University in Germany that field experiments indicated GM genes may have transferred via GM pollen to the bacteria and yeasts in the gut of bee larvae(50). 
</p>
<p>
	英国农业部在评论的FDA的文献的时候指出，在农业和农产品加工的过程中，可能因为植物灰尘和空气中的花粉而导致基因转移，这些警告随着德国Jena 大学的田野实验报告而更加明显，该报告指出被转基因可能通过转基因花粉进入到细菌和蜜蜂幼体的酵母菌中
</p>
<p>
	20 Plant DNA is not readily degraded during most commercial food processing(51). Procedures such as grinding and milling left grain DNA largely intact, as did heat-treatment at 90deg.C. Plants placed in silage showed little degradation of DNA, and a special UK MAFF report advises against using GM plants or plant waste in animal feed. 
</p>
<p>
	植物的DNA在大多数的商业食品加工中都不会被降解，通过磨碎，包括在90度的加热，都只显示轻微的DNA降解，英国农业部报告反对使用转基因植物和植物肥料用于动物喂食。

	22. Antibiotic resistance marker genes from GM plants have been found to transfer horizontally to soil bacteria and fungi in the laboratory(53). Field monitoring revealed that GM sugar beet DNA persisted in the soil for up to two years after the GM crop was planted. And there is evidence suggesting that parts of the transgenic DNA have transferred horizontally to bacteria in the soil(54).

	23. Recent research in gene therapy and nucleic acid (both DNA and RNA) vaccines leaves little doubt that naked/free nucleic acids can be taken up, and in some cases, incorporated into the genome of all mammalian cells including those of human beings. Adverse effects already observed include acute toxic shock, delayed immunological reactions and autoimmune reactions(55).

	24. The British Medical Association, in their interim report (published May, 1999), called for an indefinite moratorium on the releases of GMOs pending further research on new allergies, the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and the effects of transgenic DNA.

	25. In the Cartegena Biosafety Protocol successfully negotiated in Montreal in January, 2000, more than 130 governments have agreed to implement the precautionary principle, and to ensure that biosafety legislations at the national and international levels take precedence over trade and financial agreements at the WTO. Similarly, delegates to the Codex Alimentarius Commission Conference in Chiba Japan, March 2000, have agreed to prepare stringent regulatory procedures for GM foods that include pre-market evaluation, long-term monitoring for health impacts, tests for genetic stability, toxins, allergens and other unintended effects(56). The Cartegena Biosafety Protocol has now been signed by 68 Governments in Nairobi in May, 2000.

</p>
<p>
	26. We urge all Govern ments to take proper account of the now substantial scientific evidence of actual and suspected hazards arising from GM technology and many of its products, and to impose an immediate moratorium on further environmental releases, including open field trials, in accordance with the precautionary principle as well as sound science.
</p>
<p>
	我们急切的呼吁各国政府对转基因技术和产品的实际的以及被怀疑的危害进行正确的评估，马上停止对环境的进一步释放，包括停止根据预防性原则停止进行田野实验。
</p>
<p>
	27. Successive studies have documented the productivity and sustainability of family farming in the Third World as well as in the North(57). Evidence from both North and South indicates that small farms are more productive, more efficient and contribute more to economic development than large farms. Small farmers also tend to make better stewards of natural resources, conserving biodiversity and safeguarding the sustainability of agricultural production(58). Cuba responded to the economic crisis precipitated by the break up of the Soviet Bloc in 1989 by converting from conventional large scale, high input monoculture to small organic and semi-organic farming, thereby doubling food production with half the previous input(59).
</p>
<p>
	不管是来自南方还是北方的证据都显示小型农业更高效，更有经济性，小型农业更倾向于利用自然资源，保护生物多样性，和可持续农业，为了应对经济危机，古巴结束了原来的苏维埃联盟回到原来原来的组织形式，从高度的组织到小规模和半组织农业，结果一半的投入产生了此前两倍产量
</p>
<p>
	28. Agroecological approaches hold great promise for sustainable agriculture in developing countries, in combining local farming knowledge and techniques adjusted to local conditions with contemporary western scientific knowledge(60). The yields have doubled and tripled and are still increasing. An estimated 12.5 million hectares worldwide are already successfully farmed in this way(61). It is environmentally sound and affordable for small farmers. It recovers farming land marginalized by conventional intensive agriculture. It offers the only practical way of restoring agricultural land degraded by conventional agronomic practices. Most of all, it empowers small family farmers to combat poverty and hunger.

	生态农业给发展中国家带来了希望，通过对当地农业的科技的组织和针对当地条件的现代西方科技的传播，收成已经翻倍三倍并且还在持续增加，估计1250万公顷的土地已经通过这种方式取得了成功，它既对环境友好，又对小型农业具有可操作性，它恢复了被传统方式过度使用的土地，它提供了被传统农业所消耗的农田的一个唯一的实践方式，最重要的，它给小型农户带来了对饥饿和贫穷的抵抗力。
</p>
<p>
	29. We urge all Governments to reject GM crops on grounds that they are both hazardous and contrary to ecologically sustainable use of resources. Instead they should support research and development of sustainable agricultural methods that can truly benefit family farmers the world over.
