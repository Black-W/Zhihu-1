根据合理的科技及综合评估，美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）就关于来自基因工程改造（GE）的植物及动物，现正采取几项重要步骤，包括批准第一个供食用的基因工程改造动物，水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）。机构也为为那些想在其产品贴上关于产品是否含有取自基改来源信息的自愿性标签的制造商发出两份导则文件：取自基改大西洋三文鱼的标签食品导则草案，及取自于基改植物食品的最终导则。
<br>
<br>
FDA 批准水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）的申请 
<br>
FDA 已经批准水赏公司（AquaBounty Technologies｝所创造的水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）的申请，这种大西洋三文鱼比非基改农场养殖养的大西洋三文鱼能更快地普及市场。FDA根据联最新的联邦食品、药物及化妆品法案的动物药物条款规范基改动物，因为导入动物的重组 DNA（rDNA）符合药物的定义。就本案来说，rDNA 导入的结构特性使水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）加速生长。
<br>
<br>
FDA 中心－兽医医学总监，兽医博士 Bernadette Dunham 说，“FDA 已充分地分析及评估由水赏公司（AquaBounty Technologies）所提交关于水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）的数据及信息，并已决定其已满足所要求的规定，予以批准，包括可安心食用来自该鱼类的食品。” 
<br>
<br>
根据一项科技证据的综合分析，FDA 决定水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）满足联邦食品、药物及化妆品法案的安全及有效的法定要求。在这些要求中，赞助商须符合要求，即，可安心食用来自该鱼类的食品；该 rDNA结构（能使三文鱼快速成长的该项 DNA）本身对该鱼类是安全的；及水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）满足如赞助商所述－快速成长的说法。另外，FDA 决定来自水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）的食物与来自其他非基改大西洋三文鱼的食物一样安全及营养可经食用，并且水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）与其他非农场养殖的大西洋三文鱼的营养价值相比之下，无生物上的相关差异。
<br>
<br>
水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）仅得以在加拿大及巴拿马两个特定场所中的孵化水塘内进行养殖。该批准并不许可水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）在美国进行繁殖或饲养。实际上，根据本批准，美国或任何其他未经授权的场所或地点得以繁殖或饲养水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）以食品销售供美国消费者食用。如国家环境政策法案（ National Environmental Policy Act）的要求，FDA 已完成环境评估以决定该项申请是否就美国人类环境而导致重大影响。FDA 已决定水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）将不会对美国人类环境导致重大影响，因其已经采取多项重复的办法控制该鱼类并预防其逃逸而在环境中繁殖生长。
<br>
<br>
这些办法包括在水塘中及在提供场所的抽水系统中设有一系列多项及重复程度的实际障碍以防止鱼卵及鱼类的逃逸。最后，在极不可能的情况下即使逃逸，水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）并无繁殖能力，其将无法互相繁殖或在野生环境下建立其群种。
<br>
<br>
FDA 将继续该生产及场所进行定期监督，并将进行检测确保其仍执行使当地实际防漏防范措施。另外，加拿大及巴拿马政府也将对该场所进行检测。
<br>
<br>
FDA 举行了兽医顾问委员会（Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee），讨论科技评估的资格能力及一场听证会，就来自水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）的食品标签收集意见。本机构已听取并评估来自这两场会议的意见。另外，本机构发布了一份环境评估及无发现重大影响的公众意见草稿；在该代理机构作出最终决定前，其也将评估这些意见。
<br>
<br>
本机构出版了基改食品的自愿性标签导则。
<br>
 FDA 的责任旨在确保在其权限范围下满足适用安全、标签及其他法定的规定要求。来自基改的植物与动物食品必须满足如其他食品的相同要求，包括安全及标签要求。根据联邦食品、药物及化妆品法案，如材料上有所差异时，FDA 仅要求基改来源的食品须另外标签－基改产品与其非基改产品间的营养价值有所不同时。就水优基改三文鱼（AquAdvantage Salmon）一案来说，FDA 并未发现任何此类的差异。
<br>
<br>
 FDA 中心－食品安全及营养应用总监，Susan Mayne 博士说，“我们知道某些消费者有兴趣知道该食品的成分是否取自基改来源。” “FDA 发出了两份导则文件，说明食品公司要如何自愿标签其产品，提供消费者此信息。“
<br>
<br>
这两份导则文件包括自愿性标签的导则草案，说明食品是否取自基改大西洋三文鱼及一份自愿性标签的最终版导则说明该食品已经或尚未取自于基改植物。
<br>
<br>
虽然公司总可以在其产品种加入自愿性标签，只要是真实且不具误导性即可，但这些导则提供 为那些想在其产品贴上关于产品是否含有取自基改来源信息的自愿性标签的制造商一些建议性的行动。
<br>
<br>
自 11月 23日起，为期60日，该代理机构经产业导则草案的联邦注册（Federal Register）上接受公众意见。自愿性标签说明食品是否已经或尚未取自基因改造工程的大西洋三文鱼。

Based on sound science and a comprehensive review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is taking several important steps today regarding food from genetically engineered (GE) plants and animals, including the first approval for a genetically engineered animal intended for food, AquAdvantage Salmon. The agency is also issuing two guidances for manufacturers who wish to voluntarily label their products as containing ingredients from GE or non-GE sources: a draft guidance on labeling foods derived from Atlantic salmon, and a final guidance on foods derived from GE plants.
<br>
<br>
FDA approves application for AquAdvantage Salmon
<br>
<br>
The FDA has approved AquaBounty Technologies’ application for AquAdvantage Salmon, an Atlantic salmon that reaches market size more quickly than non-GE farm-raised Atlantic salmon. The FDA regulates GE animals under the new animal drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, because the recombinant DNA (rDNA) construct introduced into the animal meets the definition of a drug. In this case, the rDNA construct introduces a trait that makes the AquAdvantage Salmon grow faster.  
<br>
<br>
“The FDA has thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data and information submitted by AquaBounty Technologies regarding AquAdvantage Salmon and determined that they have met the regulatory requirements for approval, including that food from the fish is safe to eat,” said Bernadette Dunham, D.V.M., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.
<br>
<br>
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence, the FDA determined that AquAdvantage Salmon meets the statutory requirements for safety and effectiveness under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Among the requirements the sponsor had to meet are that food from the fish is safe to eat; the rDNA construct (the piece of DNA that makes the salmon grow faster) is safe for the fish itself; and the AquAdvantage Salmon meets the sponsor’s claim about faster growth. In addition, the FDA determined that food from AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe to eat and as nutritious as food from other non-GE Atlantic salmon and that there are no biologically relevant differences in the nutritional profile of AquAdvantage Salmon compared to that of other farm-raised Atlantic salmon.
<br>
<br>
The AquAdvantage Salmon may be raised only in land-based, contained hatchery tanks in two specific facilities in Canada and Panama. The approval does not allow AquAdvantage Salmon to be bred or raised in the United States. In fact, under this approval, no other facilities or locations, in the United States or elsewhere, are authorized for breeding or raising AquAdvantage Salmon that are intended for marketing as food to U.S. consumers. As required by the National Environmental Policy Act, the FDA completed an environmental assessment to determine whether approval of the application would result in significant effects on the quality of the human environment in the United States. The FDA has determined that the approval of the AquAdvantage Salmon application would not have a significant environmental impact because of the multiple and redundant measures being taken to contain the fish and prevent their escape and establishment in the environment.
<br>
<br>
These measures include a series of multiple and redundant levels of physical barriers placed in the tanks and in the plumbing that carries water out of the facilities to prevent the escape of eggs and fish. Finally, the AquAdvantage Salmon are reproductively sterile so that even in the highly unlikely event of an escape, they would be unable to interbreed or establish populations in the wild.
<br>
<br>
The FDA will maintain regulatory oversight over the production and facilities, and will conduct inspections to confirm that adequate physical containment measures remain in place. In addition, the Canadian and Panamanian governments will also be conducting inspections of the facilities.
<br>
<br>
The FDA held a Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee meeting on the sufficiency of the scientific review and a hearing to gather opinions on labeling of food from AquAdvantage Salmon. The agency received and reviewed comments from these two meetings. In addition, the agency released a draft environmental assessment and preliminary finding of no significant impact for public comment; these comments were also reviewed prior to the agency’s final decision.
<br>
<br>
Agency publishes guidances on voluntary labeling of food from genetically engineered sources
<br>
<br>
The FDA’s responsibility is to ensure that foods under its purview meet applicable safety, labeling, and other statutory and regulatory requirements. Foods derived from GE plants and animals must meet the same requirements, including safety and labeling requirements, as other foods. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA can only require additional labeling of foods derived from GE sources if there is a material difference – such as a different nutritional profile – between the GE product and its non-GE counterpart. In the case of the AquAdvantage Salmon, the FDA did not find any such differences.
<br>
<br>
“We recognize that some consumers are interested in knowing whether food ingredients are derived from GE sources,” said Susan Mayne, Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. “The FDA is issuing two guidance documents that explain how food companies that want to voluntarily label their products can provide this information to consumers.”
<br>
<br>
These two guidance documents include a draft guidance on voluntary labeling indicating whether food has or has not been derived from GE Atlantic salmon, and a final guidance on voluntary labeling indicating whether food has or has not been derived from GE plants. 
<br>
<br>
Although companies can always voluntarily add labeling to their products as long as it’s truthful and not misleading, these guidances provide recommended actions for manufacturers who may wish to voluntarily label their products with information about whether the foods contain ingredients from GE sources.  
<br>
<br>
The agency is accepting public comment for 60 days starting on November 23 via instructions in the Federal Register on Draft Guidance for Industry: Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Food Has or Has Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Atlantic Salmon.
<br>
<br>
