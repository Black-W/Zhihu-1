, the chief technology officer at Monsanto, said The Times had cherry-picked its data to reflect poorly on the industry. “Every farmer is a smart businessperson, and a farmer is not going to pay for a technology if they don’t think it provides a major benefit,” he said. “Biotech tools have clearly driven yield increases enormously.”

文中最有力的证据是这个

	One measure, contained in data from the United States Geological Survey, shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides. Since genetically modified crops were introduced in the United States two decades ago for crops like corn, cotton and soybeans, the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third, but the spraying of herbicides, which are used in much higher volumes, has risen by 21 percent.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, in France, use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen by a far greater percentage — 65 percent — and herbicide use has decreased as well, by 36 percent.

	说用了转基因以来，美国杀虫剂使用量减少了1/3， 而除草剂用量增加了21%；对比法国，杀虫剂的使用量减少了65%，除草剂用量减少了36%
</p>
<p>
	这个数据不能说被裁剪，但是他应该列举出使用量/作物产量的数据，而不是总量的数据。

		法国计划大幅削减杀虫剂使用量

	 另外，杀虫剂的使用量下降，是人为的还是必须的，值得商榷。
