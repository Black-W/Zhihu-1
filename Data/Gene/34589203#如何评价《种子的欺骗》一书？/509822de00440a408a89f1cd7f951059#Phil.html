查一下作者的背景就知道了：

<br>
<br>
还能查到这哥们儿当年做“瑜伽漂浮”的照片：

再看看他当年加入的这个Nature Law Party是干吗的：

<br>
在我看来，这个组织就是一个神棍集团，这哥们儿也就是神棍一枚，在美国实际上没有什么学术认可度，这里纽约客上有一篇文章里就提到：
<br>
<blockquote>
	On the show, Oz identified Smith as a scientist, 
	<b>
		but Smith has no experience in genetics or agriculture, and has no scientific degree from any institution
	</b>
	. He studied business at the Maharishi International University, founded by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Before the show aired, 
	<b>
		Bruce Chassy, a noted molecular biologist
	</b>
	, wrote to Oz; he is a founder of Academics Review, a group of researchers who often debunk popular scientific claims. Chassy is professor emeritus in the department of food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois. “As a public-sector scientist, researcher, and academic administrator with more than forty years’ experience, I am appalled that any medical professional would give a platform to the likes of Mr. Jeffrey Smith to impart health information to the public,” Chassy wrote. “
	<b>
		His only professional experience prior to taking up his crusade against biotechnology is as a ballroom-dance teacher, yogic flying instructor, and political candidate for the Maharishi cult’s natural-law party.
	</b>
	”

在科学技术领域，还应该让有过专业技术背景的专业人员来参与，而不是神棍。

所以这本书嘛...饭后茶余做谈资就够了，千万别当真。
