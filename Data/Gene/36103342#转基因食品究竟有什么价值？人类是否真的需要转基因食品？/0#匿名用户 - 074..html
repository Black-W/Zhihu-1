随着时间的推移，人口是会增长的。当土壤耕力无法满足传统作物需要的时候，就需要转基因农作物。而且你真的认为目前全世界每个人都能吃饱饭了吗？
<br>
第二就是关于农药的问题，农药残留是农作物安全上很重要的问题。而转基因的方法实实在在是改变此问题的一个重要途径。
<br>
还有一个关于社会发展问题，随着发展，我国从事农业的人口会越来越少，而为了满足生活需求，我国耕作的土壤必须保持在一定的限度。那么就意味着人力与管理出现矛盾。转基因能很大程度提高作物的抗逆性。可以节约成本。

一点个人观点

关于评论区说人口数目。只能强行上论文了。

The United Nations (UN) recently released population projections based on data until 2012 and a Bayesian probabilistic methodology. Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations.
