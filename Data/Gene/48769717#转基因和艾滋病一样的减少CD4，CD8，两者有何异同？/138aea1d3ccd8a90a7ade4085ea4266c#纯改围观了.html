你还是看看论文的总结吧，此论文的结论也明确指出，尚未证明此类血清免疫差异是否具有免疫学上的意义。也就是说这浓度差别还不能说对免疫系统有什么影响。并不能说明是免疫失调。

	好比我白血球含量原先为3，现在为6，而化验的报警线是20。没错3和6差别是很大，但是距离20那都很远，从生物学上讲没什么差异。

	These mycotoxins are frequent con-taminants of maize and may exert immunotoxic activity,
	<br>
	depending on dose, exposure, and timing of administration (20, 21).Nevertheless, in agreement with previous studies (22), the increases of DON and FB1 were modest, their levels being
	<br>
	slightly higher than the maximum allowable concentration and much lower than those known to affect the immune response (23-25). In addition, the immune markers of the animals fed
	<br>
	control maize did not differ from those of animals fed the commercial nontransgenic maize.
