这就是关于转基因食物优缺点的作文：Genetically modified food is science brings us the product, now of cultivated land area of less, genetically modified food will play more and more important role, if the use of transgenic technology can solve the world food shortage problem, it is not quite good? Genetically modified food in the world now is a kind of new things, new things, people need time to promote its accept also need some time, we cannot put new things in the cradle, a stick to it from the beginning, that cannot be eaten of genetically modified food. You think we don't of hybrid rice is a genetically modified food? But we can open it from? And if they can pass the soybeans genetically modified technique using atmospheric nitrogen inside his produces fertilizers to other crops gene transfer in the mankind, it is. Everything is both sides, especially technology, science and technology is a double-edged sword? Genetically modified food has its disadvantages, like some worry, because it will not change, will destroy genetic evolution, etc. Genetically modified food and nutrition inside it isn't like that, the propaganda of people worry is understandable, after accepting a new things take time. But we also should see the benefits of them, I think as time slowly past, genetically modified foods will be accepted by people.  期望会对你有协助吧，谢谢！ 质疑转基因的观念：请重点重视“绿色平和”安排的网站，还有回转斗士Jeffrey M.Smith的作品。
附和转基因的观念：请重视“孟山都”公司的网站，还有科普名人方舟子的博客。

个人认为，支撑转基因的公司或个人或多或少有商业利益在其间，而对立观念的科学性强一些。

如果您有心作此方面研讨，最好能调查一下，关于转基因食物（如大豆、玉米、玉米油等）
1. 在我国鼓吹推行转基因最热心的专家看他们是否自己活跃食用，
2. 国家部委的子弟幼儿园是否活跃食用，
3. 看大型世界赛事和世界会议是否活跃食用，
或许，这才可以了解国家相关领导和专家对转基因食物的心里实在看法。
